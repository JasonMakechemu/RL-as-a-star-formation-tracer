# RL-as-a-star-formation-tracer
This repository contains the code I used to obtain results for my paper (in prep) titled 'Environmental Dependence of Radio Continuum as a Star Formation Tracer'.

We use machine learning techniques applied to observational data from VLA, COSMOS, and allWISE catalogues to invesitage the reliabity of 1.4GHz radio luminosity is as a tracer of star formation within galaxies in a multitude of environments; regardless of morphology, mass, luminosity, and other galaxy characteristics.

In short - 1.4GHz radio luminosity is not an accurate tracer of star formation in any environment, however, the effectiveness of its tracer capabilities becomes even less reliable at flux densities above ~0.2mJy. This is where we see a larger omout of AGN in the COSMOS sample of galaxies, and it is where we expect a stronger contribution from other non star forming processes that still contribute to the radio continuum emission.
